        <h2 id="cover-letter" class="greeting">Dear Urban Alliance on Race Relations,</h2>
            <div class="letter-body">
                <p>I am thrilled to apply for this role, supporting the Urban Alliance on Race Relations in building a website for the Anti-Racism in Education Project. This project excites me not only as a growing web developer and designer but also as a community organizer, anti-racism, equity and accessibility consultant, and journalism graduate who often investigated systemic inequity in education (such as the impacts of academic streaming on Black and brown students).</p>
                <p>While spearheading communications and project management for over eight years, I have led with my passion for community building and making information and education more accessible, understandable and engaging to the public. As a J-School graduate and communications professional with experience in non-profits, academia and public service, I have produced high-quality multimedia deliverables for a diversity of stakeholders and audiences, regularly developed and managed e-newsletters, social media channels, websites and web copy, planned and advised on content development, policies and strategies and ensured compliance with brand and content style guidelines and accessibility standards.</p>
                <p>Recently, I completed Seneca’s Web Development and Design Certificate Program, deepening my project management, UX design, strategic communications, stakeholder engagement and quality assurance skills when building accessible, cross-browser compatible and responsive websites, as you will see in <a href="#portfolio">my portfolio</a> below.</p>
                <p>In both my academic and professional career, equity, anti-racism, and accessibility in user experience have been central to my work. Witnessing and experiencing the deeply rooted systemic racism in policies, practices and the very fabric and culture of higher education, journalism schools, workplaces and the field, I worked to establish an Anti-Racism and Equity Committee at Carleton University’s J-School, consulted on curriculum, policies and pedagogical approaches, and organized events and facilitated discussions centring the experiences of Black, Indigenous and people of the global majority, addressing and disrupting how systemic racism and inequity were normalized.</p>
                <p>My lived experience, academic and professional background, and commitment to ongoing learning give me the expertise and drive to support the Urban Alliance on Race Relations in designing this new website.</p>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I look forward to hearing from you and discussing this opportunity further.</p>
                <p>Sincerely,<br>Gowlene Selvavijayan</p>

                            <p>Artists Mentoring Youth is a Toronto-based performance arts mentorship and training program for gender diverse youth and women (ages 16-29). I supported them in troubleshooting and archiving their old website and its content while developing, restructuring and launching their new website. This included a logo redesign and mini rebrand. During their site migration and relaunch, I worked to maintain their brand recognition and their SEO rankings.</p>

                            <p>Original Manna is a Black-owned all-natural local Canadian beauty skincare and wellness company. As Original Manna continues to grow, my client wanted to move away from Etsy
                            for sales. I developed a fully functional e-commerce site and spearheaded a rebrand with a brand new logo to support my client in strengthening their brand presence, integrating social media, having greater control over SEO and advertising, and expanding their reach further.</p>

                            <p>This is a student concept project with fictional branding. My cohort at Seneca's Web Development and Design program was assigned to develop a webpage exploring any colour of our choosing. I enjoyed using Bootstrap to dive into YInMn Blue and make this fully responsive website that adjusts and changes in different ways across various devices and screen sizes. Some fun features include a carousel and an accordion.</p>
